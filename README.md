The game that we have implemented is influenced by the mobile game Tap Away. The purpose of the game is to clear the screen by selecting the boxes which moves in the direction of their arrow once their selected. If the selected box is blocked by another box, it will move until it reaches the blocking box.

PS2mouse, Audio, HEX display are implemented in the design.
